2. Problems
I had some issues regarding the interest calculation especially with different compound frequencies. A long suite of tests helped me find the right solution
New things i learned was to use the ref when passing arguments to methods. Worked like a charm for my application. 
Also learned to use Json for the first time. Very convenient.
