Simple school project to manage money.
You can add/edit/remove transactions and calculate interest over time.

Its all basic libraries like Linq and Regex nothing out of the ordinary. 

2. Problems i faced
I had some issues regarding the interest calculation especially with different compound frequencies. A long suite of tests helped me find the right solution
New things i learned was to use the ref when passing arguments to methods. Worked like a charm for my application. 
Also learned to save/load Json files for the first time. Very convenient for my app.
